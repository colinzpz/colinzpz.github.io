title: "Self-sustainable Sensor Networks with Multi-source Energy Harvesting and Wireless Charging"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/infocom19
excerpt: Energy supply remains to be a major bottleneck in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). A self-sustainable network operates without battery replacement. Recent efforts employ multi-source energy harvesting to power sensors with ambient energy. Meanwhile, wireless charging is considered in WSNs as a reliable energy source. It motivates us to integrate both fields of research to build a self-sustainable network and guarantee operation under any weather condition. We propose a three-step solution to optimize this new framework. We first solve the Sensor Composition Problem (SCP) to derive the percentage of different types of sensors. Then we enable self-sustainability by bringing energy harvesting storage to the field for charging the Mobile Charger (MC). Next, we propose a 3-factor approximation algorithm to schedule sensor charging and energy replenishment of MC. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate significant improvement of network lifetime and reduction of network cost. The network lifetime can be extended at least three times compared with traditional approaches and the charging capability of MC increases at least 100%.
